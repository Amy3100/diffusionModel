Description: To calculate Network diffusion contains mainly two steps: creating Signalling Network (SigNet) and
	     use SigNet output in calculate single-sample network connectivity. This function uses the diffusion equation to calculate single-sample network connectivity 
	     based on signal strength between context-specific receptors and TFs.This is achieved using aggregate accumulation of signal per node as a function of time.
